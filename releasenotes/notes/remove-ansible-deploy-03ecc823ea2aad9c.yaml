    Ansible-deploy interface and drivers using it were removed from
    ironic-staging-drivers project. The ``ansible`` deploy interface is now
    part of ironic project itself, please use the implementation defined there.

    The ``ansible`` deploy interface must be explicitly enabled in ironic's
    configuartion file, can only be used with hardware types, with any hardware
    type defined in either ironic (except for ``oneview``) or
    ironic-staging-drivers (except for ``staging-amt``) projects.
    The correspondence matrix is

    - ``staging-ansible`` deploy interface ⟶ ``ansible`` deploy interface
    - ``staging-ansible-ipmi`` hardware type ⟶ ``ipmi`` hardware type
      with ``ansible`` deploy interface
    -  ``pxe-ipmitool-ansible`` classic driver ⟶ ``ipmi`` hardware type
       with ``ansible`` deploy interface
    - ``pxe-libvirt-ansible`` classic driver ⟶ ``staging-libvirt``
      hardware type with ``ansible`` deploy interface

    Note that the version in ironic does not support heartbeat-less operation,
    so if you were using ansible interface with
    ``[ansible]/use_ramdisk_callback = False`` option in the ironic's
    configuartion file, you must rebuild your ramdisk to include a client
    for ``lookup`` and ``heartbeat`` endponints of ironic API
    (for example ``ironic-python-agent``).
