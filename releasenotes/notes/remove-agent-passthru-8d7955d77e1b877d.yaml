upgrade:
  - Implementations and dependency on Ironic Python Agent (IPA)
    lookup/heartbeats as vendor passthru methods is removed from
    all drivers in ``ironic-staging-drivers`` as it has been deprecated
    and removed from ironic as well.

    Effectively, ``AMT``, ``iBoot``, ``Libvirt`` and ``WoL`` drivers
    no longer have any vendor passthru methods.
    ``Intel NodeManager`` drivers still have most of their vendor passthru
    methods related to IPMI and Intel NodeManager-specific extensions,
    except for ``lookup`` and ``heartbeat`` vendor passthru methods.

    This also means that drivers in ``ironic-staging-drivers`` are now
    incompatible with ironic < 6.1.0 and IPA < 1.5.0.
    On upgrade of ironic-staging-drivers, operators must ensure that their
    ironic version and verison of IPA in deploy ramdisks is compatible and
    upgrade those too if needed.
    Users of custom (non-IPA-based) implementations for lookup/heartbeats
    from ramdisk are required to update those to use ironic API v1.22.
