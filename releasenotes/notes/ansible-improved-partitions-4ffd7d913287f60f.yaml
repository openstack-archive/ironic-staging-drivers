features:
  - |
    ``parted`` module for Ansible was renamed to ``ironic_parted`` to not
    shadow the ``parted`` module included in Ansible 2.3.
    It was also rewritten to be cleaner and more stable

    - changed accepted module arguments
    - added support for units (MiB and % for now)
    - added more validations
    - left support for msdos and gpt partition tables only
    - partitions are created one by one, and actual block devices created
      are searched for and reported.

  - |
    Ansible-deploy with local-booted partition images now creates
    a partitioning scheme that closer resembles what's being done by
    drivers that use ``ironic-python-agent``.

    - for partition images the root partition is the last one created
      so that it can grow with e.g. when using cloud-init's growroot
    - for whole-disk images, configdrive is created as far as possible

upgrade:
  - |
    ``parted`` module previosly provided by ansible-deploy driver was renamed
    to ``ironic_parted`` and has significantly changed its interface and
    returned values.

    **Any out-of-tree playbooks utilizing the ``parted`` module supplied that
    was provided by ansible-deploy driver are incompatible with this release and
    must be changed accordingly to use the new module name and arguments!**
