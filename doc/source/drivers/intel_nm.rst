Intel NodeManager drivers
#########################

Overview
========

This driver implements support of Intel NodeManager platform via ironic
vendor interface methods. Those methods are implemented as sending raw bytes
over IPMI.
Hardware with Intel NodeManager 1.5 or above is required, feature must be
enabled via Flash Image Tool. The driver detects internal addresses of
NodeManager device automatically.
The main term for NodeManager is ``policy``, which represents power, thermal
or boot mode limit. Each policy identified by ``policy_id`` (integer number
from 0 to 255). Maximum numbers of policies which can be set at the same
time limited by platfotm.
For more detailed information see full specification [1]_.

Available drivers
=================

Driver provided by ironic-staging-drivers are

agent_ipmitool_nm
    Standard Ironic's ``agent_ipmitool`` driver with Intel NodeManager
    as vendor extension
